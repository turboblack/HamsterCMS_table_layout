<div align="left">In the 90s, the Internet was just beginning to conquer the masses, <br>
and the web pages of that time were distinguished by their unique aesthetics <br>
and simplicity.<br><br>

This was the era when designers and web developers first began <br>
to explore the possibilities of the web and create simple yet amazing pages.<br><br>

One of the defining features of 90s web pages was bright colors and high-contrast <br>
combinations. Background images and gradients were used throughout, creating <br>
a unique style that many remember with nostalgia.<br><br>

A time when every page felt unique and experimental.<br>
Text on 90s web pages was typically large and bold, <br>
sometimes using bright highlighters or flash. Animated GIFs and flickering text <br>
banners were also in vogue, adding dynamism and playfulness to the online space.<br><br>

Menus on web pages in the '90s often featured colorful buttons with 3D effects.<br>
Navigation could be complex and confusing, but at the same time it gave the pages <br>
their own unique personality. An important element of web design at the time was <br>
emoji and animated icons, which added fun and emotion to the visual experience.<br><br>

Guest books, where users could leave their comments and animated GIF captions, <br>
were popular forms of online communication. Although simple and imperfect, 90s <br>
web pages created a unique sense of authenticity and freedom. It was a time when <br>
every page was like a postcard, transporting you to the exciting world of the Internet, <br>
full of experiments and possibilities. Nostalgia for these days remains in the hearts <br>
of those who first plunged into the virtual space of the exciting and unknown Internet.<br></div>
