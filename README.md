What is all this for?

The script is intended for people who are not knowledgeable in programming and who want to quickly create a home page on the Internet

this script is an example of how websites should be made, as I see it, how it should be. all these thick frameworks, a bunch of additional languages, various hundred-megabyte hipster crafts just to deploy an editable home page? - this is not about this script.

Script is also useful for training, the simple code allows for this. The script is suitable for adherents of old technologies, for ascetic users, downgraders, lovers of retro computers and computer equipment, who want to create a quick, simple, and beautiful home page, or multi-page.

tests showed that the site on this template launched on a 386 computer with 16 MHz and 8 RAM under Windows 95 (it will also launch under 3.11 if Internet Explorer 5 is installed), and specifically on this engine it is easily opened by browsers under DOS, and the content is edited through the admin panel.

you can also create an HTML5 template and work with it, it’s not difficult, about 10 mouse movements, and your site is ready (if you have a ready-made template, you replace the HTML code with PHP scripts according to the instructions, link above),

in general, for minimalists this is what you need

Now a little description of this particular template.

This is a purely text template without graphics or frameworks, very easy to use, very compact, nothing superfluous. if you want to edit this script under the DOS operating system, you can do it. I tested it - it works and opens normally in the LYNX browser
the menu of this script has the property of pulling new text files from the root directory of the hosting where the CMS is located, if you create a new file in the admin panel and save it, it automatically appears in the menu

For the script to work, you only need free hosting with support for PHP 7.4 (although it will work on 5). copy the files as is to the hosting, open, check - it works. Go to the admin panel admin.php, enter your login and password (login password), select open the file at the top, edit, save. Don’t forget to also change your login and password by editing the admin.php file, the name of which can also be changed, this will not affect performance.

articles that we create in the admin panel and save below in the bottom menu by writing ./article.txt and click save. This creates a page that is not visible in the navigation bar, but will be visible separately on the page where we place the link index.php?p=article.txt

I deliberately did not write copyrights in the template, because you are erasing them)))

in addition, with copyrights the template will not look authentic

Enjoy your use.

thank you for your attention
